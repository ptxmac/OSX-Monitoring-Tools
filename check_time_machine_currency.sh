#	Check Time Machine Currency
#	by Jedda Wignall
#	http://jedda.me

#	v1.0 - 3 May 2012
#	Initial release.

#	This script checks the time machine results file on a Mac, and reports if a backup has completed within a number of minutes of the current time.
#	Takes two arguments (warning threshold in minutes, critical threshold in minutes):
#	./check_time_machine_currency.sh -w 240 -c 1440

# 	Very useful if you are monitoring client production systems, and want to ensure backups are occurring.
